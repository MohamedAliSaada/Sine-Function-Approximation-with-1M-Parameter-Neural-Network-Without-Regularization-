# Sine-Function-Approximation-with-1M-Parameter-Neural-Network-Without-Regularization-
This project demonstrates a key lesson in deep learning: bigger models don't always generalize better. We trained a neural network with over 924,000 parameters to simulate the sine function , but without any regularization techniques. The result is clear: the model fits training data but fails to generalize.
